##Companies that use Python

-   Instagram
-   Youtube
-   Industrial Light &amp; Magic
-   EVE Online

###Pros:

-   Readability (easy to understand, easy to maintain, similar to Ruby)
-   Robust set of built-ins, libraries, modules, and extensions
-   Good for asynchronous code
-   Object oriented
-   Runs anywhere (OSX, Windows, Linux, Unix)
-   Open source &amp; free

###Cons:

-   Slower speed of excecution than compiled languages.  However, many Python packages have been optimized to run at C/C++ speeds.
-   Rarely used for mobile/browser web applications (used for server and desktop platforms).
-   Dynamically typed nature of the language means it requires more testing and has errors that only show up at runtime.

Statically typed: type of variable is known at compile time (Java, C, C++)
Dynamically typed: the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. This means that
you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify
type everytime. Example: Perl, Ruby, Python



> "Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language."
> -- Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, Inc.

> "Python is fast enough for our site and allows us to produce maintainable features in record times, with a minimum of developers,"
> -- Cuong Do, Software Architect, YouTube.com

> "Python plays a key role in our production pipeline. Without it a project the size of Star Wars: Episode II would have been very difficult to pull off. From crowd rendering to batch processing to compositing, Python binds all things together,"
> -- Tommy Burnette, Senior Technical Director, Industrial Light &amp; Magic

> "Journyx technology, from the source code of our software to the code that maintains our Web site and ASP sites, is entirely based on Python. It increases our speed of development and keeps us several steps ahead of competitors while remaining easy to read and use. It's as high level of a language as you can have without running into functionality problems. I estimate that Python makes our coders 10 times more productive than Java programmers, and 100 times more than C programmers."
> -- Curt Finch, CEO, Journyx

> "Python, like many good technologies, soon spreads virally throughout your development team and finds its way into all sorts of applications and tools. In other words, Python begins to feel like a big hammer and coding tasks look like nails."
> -- Mustafa Thamer of Firaxis Games, talking about Civilization IV.[8]
